# LinkedIn Forger

**Public setup guide:** [alpeshznakrani.github.io/Linkedin-Forger](https://alpeshznakrani.github.io/Linkedin-Forger/)

**Example dashboard:** [alpeshznakrani.github.io/Linkedin-Forger/signal.html](https://alpeshznakrani.github.io/Linkedin-Forger/signal.html)

The hosted dashboard is an example workspace only. Live LinkedIn research is deliberately local: clone the repository, follow [SETUP-GUIDE.md](SETUP-GUIDE.md), or paste [INSTALL-PROMPT.md](INSTALL-PROMPT.md) into a local coding agent.

A filmable research workspace with two explicitly separate modes:

- **Example run** works offline with locally stored example records.
- **Live run** uses the locally authenticated Agent Reach LinkedIn route and a visible, read-only browser session.

Live mode does not grant unlimited access, bypass platform controls, connect with people, or send messages.

## Open the example workspace

Open `signal.html` in a modern browser. No server or LinkedIn account is required. The top bar remains labelled `Example data · no live LinkedIn session`.

## Start the live workspace

First complete the one-time LinkedIn sign-in:

```bash
uvx mcp-server-linkedin@latest --login
```

Then start the local bridge from this folder:

```bash
node live-server.mjs
```

Open:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:4317
```

Choose `Live run`. The workspace performs a harmless profile read before showing `LinkedIn connected · live read`. A configured MCP alone is not treated as proof of a working session.

## Side-by-side recording

1. Complete login before the take.
2. Start `live-server.mjs`.
3. Choose `Live run` so the visible MCP browser opens.
4. Place LinkedIn Forger on the left and the MCP browser on the right.
5. Enable `Recording privacy` if the dashboard identities should be masked.
6. Start screen capture and click `Run live research` once.

The browser visibly navigates LinkedIn with a 350 ms action delay. The dashboard receives progressive events as profiles, companies, posts, fit scores, themes, and drafts become available. No additional click is required unless LinkedIn presents a login confirmation, CAPTCHA, or security checkpoint.

Blur real names and profile photos in the LinkedIn half before publishing the recording.

For the next take, choose `3`, `5`, or `10` from the **Next run** control beside the People Finder action. **Run 10 fresh** requests up to ten people. When a live run already contains records, **Add 10 to run** retains the current evidence, excludes usernames already present, and recomputes the qualified cohort and trends from the merged evidence set.

The requested amount is a maximum, not a guaranteed result count. The installed LinkedIn people-search tool does not expose pagination or a result-limit parameter, so LinkedIn may return fewer inspectable profiles for a query. The completion state reports the returned count against the requested count instead of presenting under-delivery as a dashboard error.

## Live-run boundaries

- The saved batch size controls both fresh and additive runs and can request 3, 5, or 10 profiles.
- Profiles are processed serially.
- Tools are restricted to people search, person profiles, company profiles/posts, post search, and session closure.
- The server binds only to `127.0.0.1`.
- Browser cookies and session data are never sent to the page.
- Sending, connecting, inbox access, and publishing are not available.
- If a live search returns zero results, the interface stays empty. Example records are never mixed into a live run.
- `Run live search` starts fresh; `Add N to run` preserves and deduplicates the existing v2 run.
- Earlier sourced profiles are retained in the unified 48-hour working set with `Previous run` provenance. They remain usable in People Finder, Fit Checker, Evidence Writer, and Review Queue, but do not enter Trend Scanner aggregates without normalized evidence.

## Workspace views

| Reel beat | Product view |
| --- | --- |
| Research team and outputs | Research Overview |
| Agent Reach, MCP, and context | Setup & Context |

| Drafts and content ideas | Evidence Writer |
| Human approval | Review Queue |

## Unified 48-hour lead workspace

Live mode deduplicates the current v2 run and the preserved 19 September profile receipts into one 15-lead working set. People Finder shows all 15 with `Current run` or `Previous run` provenance. Fit Checker ranks the same set by fit score, then timing, and exposes `All`, `ICP matches`, and `Outside ICP` filters. Matches are auto-approved for drafting; exceptions are isolated for human review. Public promotions, new roles, company moves, expansions, and launches appear as sourced timing events and never increase ICP fit. Evidence Writer exposes all 15 as selectable draft tabs, and Review Queue resolves their retained source receipts.

Trend Scanner lists all 15 under **Lead coverage**, but only profiles with normalized post evidence can influence the evidence map. A legacy profile with profile/company receipts remains visible as `Profile sources only`; it is not treated as dated trend evidence.

## Data handling

Example-mode edits and review decisions are stored in browser local storage. Evidence-first live results use the `linkedin-signal-analyser-live-v2` key. Previous profile records are copied into `linkedin-signal-analyser-prior-runs-v1` for the separate reference panel; legacy trend aggregates are never imported into Trend Scanner. Source receipts include the permitted URL and retrieval time returned by the connector. No LinkedIn credentials are written into this package.

## Evidence-first Trend Scanner

Trend Scanner uses only profiles that meet the supported role, company/market, and fit requirements. A market-post search may enrich that qualified cohort but cannot replace one; zero qualified profiles produce zero themes. It deduplicates source receipts, excludes undated items from 7/14/30-day totals, and recomputes appended runs from the merged evidence set instead of adding old totals.

Four keyboard-operable views make the research easier to inspect:

- **What people discuss** maps recurring questions, complaints, launches, and changes by source breadth.
- **Recent activity** shows the dated person posts, company posts, and market-search receipts in chronological order.
- **Product launches** shows only posts with explicit launch, release, rollout, or availability language and labels them as observed announcements—not purchase intent.
- **Industry shifts** groups wider market and company-change signals while stating that a current-window sample is not a velocity claim.

The coverage map uses unique sources horizontally, represented people and companies vertically, and deduplicated mentions for bubble size. Selecting a bubble exposes observation metrics, a cautious interpretation, an editable content angle, and direct source links. The hosted example includes clearly labelled illustrative receipts; live mode uses the same views with LinkedIn source URLs and retrieval times returned by the local connector.

## Evidence-led Content Map

Evidence Writer turns each sourced theme into a usable post plan. It ranks text, carousel, poll, short-video, and single-image fit; assigns a pillar and engagement goal; proposes a non-repeating hook pattern; and shows the post structure, CTA, missing proof, sample risk, and evidence coverage. A concentrated or single-source signal is visibly downgraded instead of presented as a ready market insight.

The planning vocabulary and hook-pattern discipline are adapted from [sergebulaev/linkedin-skills](https://github.com/sergebulaev/linkedin-skills). This package does not execute that repository or send content to LinkedIn; see `THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES.md`.

Evidence Writer now has two product tabs: **Outreach drafts** and **Content map**. Content Map builds a six-slot Monday/Wednesday/Friday schedule with topic, format, pillar, goal, readiness, source count, and production state. Text posts, PDF carousel slide copy, static-image treatments, and short-video scripts use format-specific generation actions. Generated states and the selected asset persist locally; every output remains a draft requiring human review.
